# Step 2
# Index the transcriptome
# ---
# Next, weâ€™re going to build an index on our transcriptome.
# The index is a structure that salmon uses to quasi-map RNA-seq reads during quantification.
# The index need only be constructed once per transcriptome,
# and it can then be reused to quantify many experiments.
# We use the index command of salmon to build our index:

salmon index -t $Transcriptome -i transcripts_index --keepDuplicates -k 27

# Step 3
# Quantifying transcripts
# ---
# -l        If set to A then Automatically detect the library type
# --dumpEq  Write a file in the auxiliary directory, called eq_classes.txt
#           that contains the equivalence classes and corresponding counts that
#           were computed during quasi-mapping.
# --seqBiasPassing  Enable it to learn and correct for sequence-specific biases
#                   in the input data.
# --gcBias  Learn and correct for fragment-level GC biases in the input data
